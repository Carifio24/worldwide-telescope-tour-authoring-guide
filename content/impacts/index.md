In 2014 the AAS WorldWide Telescope team produced a tour called “Impacts” that
showed how to create experiences that look great on a flat screen, in the
planetarium dome, and even in VR goggles. This section shows how you can put
on the Impacts tour yourself and gathers many resources that show you how it
was constructed.

# Show Overview

“Impacts” includes a narration and original music soundtrack and brings
audiences to the locations of impacts in the past several billion years. Made
for VR and domes, the show creates new levels of immersion to bring the
visitor to the surfaces of bodies in our Solar System as well as a tour of the
International Space Station (ISS). The senses of immersion and physical
presence in the virtual environments are especially powerful when viewed in
virtual reality (VR). Moreover, the show illustrates how AAS WorldWide
Telescope can be used in high level production. Additionally, the components
of the show are made available for adaptation, customization and re-use.

The presentation can be done using the voice of the recorded narrator or you
can have a presenter deliver the narration live. The script has been
translated into several languages.
